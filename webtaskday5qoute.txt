		<h1> ABOUT SAMBHAJI MAHARAJ</h1>
	<blockquote>At the age of nine, <strong>Sambhaji</strong> was taken as a political hostage of the Mughal Empire, to guarantee his 
father's compliance with the treaty of Purandar.
 He later accompanied his father to Agra where both were placed under house arrest by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb; 
they subsequently escaped. He was later confined by his father at <em>Panhala Fort</em>, with some theories suggesting that it
 was due to his addiction to "sensual pleasures" or for violating a <mark>Brahmin woman</mark>. He subsequently defected to the Mughal
 Empire and served under <sub>Diler Khan </sub>in the Battle of Bhupalgarh against his father. He ascended the throne following his
 father's death, with his rule being largely shaped by the ongoing wars between <ins>the Marathas and the Mughal Empire, as well as
 other neighbouring powers such as the <sup>Siddi of Janjira</sup>, the Wadiyars of Mysore and the Portuguese Empire in Goa.</blockqoute></ins>
