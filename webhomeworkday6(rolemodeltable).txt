	<blockquote><b>.</b> Sambhaji <u>(<q>Sambhajiraje Shivajiraje Bhonsle</q>) </b></u><i>14 May 1657 – 11 March 1689)</i>.<br> <b>.</b>Sambhaji Raje is also known as <b><q>Shambhuraje</b></q>, ruled from <i>1681 to 1689</i> as the second king <b>(Chhatrapati) of the Maratha Empire</b>, a prominent state in early modern India. He was the eldest son of Shivaji Raje, the founder of the Maratha Empire.At the age of nine, Sambhaji was taken as a political hostage of the Mughal Empire, to guarantee his father's compliance with the treaty of Purandar. He later accompanied his father to Agra where both were placed under house arrest by the Mughal Emperor <sub>Aurangzeb</sub>; they subsequently escaped. He was later confined by his father at <sup>Panhala Fort</sup>, with some theories suggesting that it was due to his addiction to "sensual pleasures" or for violating a Brahmin woman.He subsequently defected to the Mughal Empire and served under Diler Khan in the Battle of Bhupalgarh against his father. He ascended the throne following his father's death, with his rule being largely shaped by the ongoing wars between the Marathas and the Mughal Empire, as well as other neighbouring powers such as the Siddi of <b>Janjira</b>, the Wadiyars of Mysore and the Portuguese Empire in Goa.

		<blockquote><b>.</b> Sambhaji Raje</b></u> is viewed poorly by historians, who note that his personal problems—and war crimes committed by his soldiers—overshadowed his moderate military and administrative successes.Maratha soldiers under <q>Sambhaji's</q> command during his campaigns committed atrocities against civilians including massacres and mass rape.As a ruler,<em> Sambhaji implemented drought relief measures and encouraged agricultural development while continuing his father's administrative systems.</em> He was also a scholar who authored several works in Sanskrit and Hindustani, including the political treatise <mark>Budhbhushanam.</mark> His torture and death at the hands of the Mughal Empire elevated him to the status of a martyr. He remains popular in modern India among many Hindu nationalists.
	    Sambhaji was born at Purandar fort to the Maratha Chhtrapati, Shivaji, and his first wife, Saibai, who died when he was two years old. He was then raised by his paternal grandmother <ins><b>Jijabai</b></ins>. At the age of nine, Sambhaji was sent to live with Raja Jai Singh I of Amber as a political hostage to ensure compliance with the Treaty of Purandar that Shivaji had signed with the Mughals on <u><i>11 June 1665</i></u>. As a result of the treaty, Sambhaji became a Mughal mansabdar. He and his father Shivaji attended the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's court at Agra on<i> <ins>12 May 1666.</i> </ins>Aurangzeb put both of them under house arrest but they escaped on <u><i>22 July 1666</i></u>.However, the two sides reconciled and had cordial relations during the period <u><i>1666–1670</i></u>.

	 	<blockqoute><b>.</b> Sambhaji was married to Jivubai in a marriage of political alliance and as per Maratha custom, she took the name <u><b>Yesubai</b></u>. Jivubai was the daughter of Pilaji Shirke, who had entered Shivaji's service following the defeat of Deshmukh Suryaji Surve who was his previous liege. This marriage thus gave Shivaji the access of the region of Konkan coastal belt.Yesubai had two children, daughter Bhavani Bai and then a son named<b> Shahu</b> I, who later became the Chhatrapati of the Maratha kingdom. According to Maasir-i-Alamgiri, daughters of Sambhaji and his brother Rajaram were married to Mughal noblemen.</blockqoute></td>

	 			<blockqoute><b>.</b>During his reign, Sambhaji Raje was unable to accomplish much for his people. However, his death elevated him to the status of a martyr.Sambhaji has been considered a <b><u><mark>dharmaveer </mark>(protector of dharma)</u></b> for his role in shepherding the young Maratha empire, although not all commentators agree on the designation, which implies a religious aspect to his life and governance.Many statues of Sambhaji exist in India. Sambhaji is viewed positively by the modern Indian Hindu movement, as he is seen as emblematic of <b>Hindavi Swarajya</b> (Hindu self-rule). However,Hindu nationalist icons such as V. D. Savarkar and M. S. Golwalkar had a negative view of Sambhaji. Savarkar found Sambhaji to be "unfit to rule over the Maratha empire".
				The Hindu assesses that <b><b style="border:2px solid orange;">"Sambhaji's fealty to the Hindu dharma in the face of certain death has earned him much admiration from Hindu nationalists. Some early Marathi writers, however, portrayed him as irresponsible and wayward. Yet others have held him up as a figure of unwavering valiance who inspired the Marathas in their fight against the Mughals."</b></blockqoute></td></u></b>
